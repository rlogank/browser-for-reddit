# Browser for Reddit
This app is a React client for browsing Reddit. It is not yet complete; I am working on it daily.

## Features
 - Fetch posts from reddit api and display them on a custom grid
 - Filter posts by subreddit in realtime
 - Allows you to quickly see if a thread's comments are generally positive, or negative, and how much so

## Todo
 - Finish individual post pages
 - Create subreddit pages
 - Create profile pages
 - Create login page
 - Create settings page
 - Add a way to paste reddit post/comment link, and get sentiment stats for it
 - Add a way to search for a user and get sentiment stats for their posts
 - Add expanded-view to post cards
 - Optimize fetches with caching as to not hit reddit's api too often
 - Un-abandon the light theme
 - Allow user to upvote/downvote posts
 - Allow user to comment on posts
 - Allow user to DM people
 - Add a "save" button to posts
 - Think of more todos
